# Audit Agent Findings Log

This file is the shared memory for all audit agents in `testing/`.

Every audit run appends its novel findings here. When a finding appears in **2 or
more separate runs**, the agent that discovered it integrates it permanently into
the relevant `testing/*.md` source file and re-syncs to `.claude/commands/`.

## Findings

### Finding 1: grossProfit = revenue for SaaS tickers (FMP field mapping)
**Agent:** audit-valuation
**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Ticker / Context:** NOW (ServiceNow)
**Run count:** 1
**Status:** integrated — fix shipped in commit 7247ea4

**Observed:** FMP returns `grossProfit = totalRevenue` for certain SaaS tickers,
producing 100% gross margin across all historical rows.
**Expected:** Real gross margin (~76.6% for NOW). `businessProfile.grossMargin`
(Yahoo `financialData.grossMargins`) is correct and available.
**File / location:** `app/api/financials/route.ts` ~line 917 (post-`isHistoricalRows`)
**Suggested check to add:** Guard: if all `grossProfit/revenue > 0.97` rows exist,
re-derive gross profit from `businessProfile.grossMargin`.

### Finding 2: _auditBundle quote missing peRatio
**Agent:** audit-valuation
**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Ticker / Context:** NOW (ServiceNow)
**Run count:** 1
**Status:** integrated — fix shipped in commit 7247ea4

**Observed:** `_auditBundle.quote` lacked `peRatio`, causing `deriveExitPE` to fall
through to sector-median-only (38×) instead of the 55/35 blend (~58× for NOW).
**Expected:** `q.trailingPE` passed through; blend correctly anchors to current P/E.
**File / location:** `app/api/financials/route.ts` ~line 1427 `_auditBundle`
**Suggested check to add:** Verify `assumptionAudit.exitPE` is not equal to the raw
sector median — if it is, the `peRatio` field is missing from the audit bundle.

### Finding 3: EBIT = null collapses NOPAT for SaaS tickers
**Agent:** audit-valuation
**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Ticker / Context:** NOW (ServiceNow); likely also CRM, WDAY, VEEV
**Run count:** 1
**Status:** integrated — fix shipped in commit 7247ea4

**Observed:** Yahoo provides no `operatingIncome`/`ebit` for certain SaaS companies.
All EBIT branches in `buildProjectedRows` leave `ebit = null` → NOPAT = null →
UFCF line collapses silently in Full DCF Table.
**Expected:** Fallback: `ebit = revenue × medianNetMargin / (1 − taxRate)`.
**File / location:** `lib/valuation/normalizeInputs.ts` ~line 462
**Suggested check to add:** After auditing EBIT rows, confirm projected UFCF rows are
non-null. If all UFCF = null but netIncome is positive, the EBIT fallback is not firing.
